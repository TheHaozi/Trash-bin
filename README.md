# ♻️ Recyclable Trash Bin

Welcome, visitor.

This repository is a digital cabinet of curiosities, filled with unfinished dreams. Please view it as a workbench, not a museum.

You might find:

· 🔨 Tools & Scripts: Small utilities that might save you time.
· 🎨 Creative Experiments: Mainly related to game development and generative art.
· 📚 Learning Notes: My personal notes on various technical topics.
· 🗑️ Genuine Trash: Authentic unfinished dreams.

If you find something useful, inspiring, or even just amusing, I'd love to hear about it! This makes rummaging through the trash meaningful.
